## Description

To dynamically and quickly create a workout with exercise data, Express, Mongo with a Mongoose schema, Heroku were utilized to:

- Serve and display a working data base of workouts with excercise(s) started and workouts that have been completed

## Installation

1. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules, .DS store and .env. This ensures that the node_modules directory and your Atlas credentials aren't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
2. Use the command-line, npm i, to install Express, dotenv, and mongoose npm and morgan npm.
3. To start creating and completeting workouts using Express, use the command, node server.js and navigate in the web browser to localhost:8080.

## Usage

- Express and Heroku are used to serve and display to the user web pages to create their HTML exercises.
- Path is used to render the HTML.
- Once the user's information regarding:
  - created excercise is inputed into the form:
- An HTML file with the user's added workout and unique id is created.
- /stats route displays the user's completed workouts and total weights lifted.

## Test

Seed the database from the seed.js file by running the command, npm run seed. Then test the different HTML pages/positions on the local host using Morgan npm, to ensure that the routes are firing and the Mongoose database is accessed.
